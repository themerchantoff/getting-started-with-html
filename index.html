<h1>Getting started with HTML</h1>

<b>The Basics of the Web</b>
<p>The web is made up of lots of <b><em>HTML</em></b> documents, <em>HTML</em> stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Languge</em>. So we can difine that a web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.<a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/getting_started/article.php/3869776/Web-Development-The-Need-to-Know-Basics.htm">This page</a> is a grate way to start. <br><br>✤Text content (what you can see) ✤Markup(What it looks like) ✤Links to other pages ✤References to other documents(images and videos)
</p>

<b>Basic Programing</b>
<p>There are 6 important tags that "every" programer should know:<br>
  ✤<b>b</b> tag --> Makes "contents" <b>bold</b>.<br>
  ✤<b>em</b>  tag --> Makes "contents" <em>italic</em>.<br>
  ✤<b>br</b> tag --> Which is a inline, and makes space betwen lines.<br>
  ✤<b>p</b> tag  --> Whis is a block makes diffrent paragrahs.<br>
  ✤<b>a</b> tag --> Makes text into a hyperlink(ex.-"www.google.com")<br>
  ✤<b>image</b> tag --> Links an imaage to your HTML docuemt.<br><br>HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.<br>
  ≅<b>Inline Elements</b>-->a, b, em, image. ≅<b>Block Elements</b>-->p
  <!-- Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (<p> for example) and a closing tag, (</p>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the <br> tag).
Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
 Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write <a href="www.udacity.com"-->
  </p>

<b>Computers are stupid</b>
<p>What this menas isn't <em>literally</em> that computers are stupid, simply that if you make a mistake, the computer isn't going to forgive it and run normally, because that is what it was designed for.
